## Recommendations

 * Based on the trends found Bellbeat should focus marketing the activity features on their Watch product as it is the most similar to the data. Based on the Fitbit Data most users tracked their Activity Levels, Calories, and their steps so the same could be true for their Watch Product.
 * Due to the small sample size more research should be made on why users are not using the weight tracking and sleep features. Are there areas of improvement that people would like to see in the Fitbit that we could add to Bellbeat products or are people not aware of the feature and or the health benefits of tracking those statistics. This will potentially push Bellbeat to be an even stronger competitor in the market.  
 * Since we can see in the data that users sedentary minutes was the highest this means that  users are still wearing their Fitbit watch even when they're not doing any activity. I would recommend for Bellbeat to add reminders and or suggestions for users to get become active such as going on a walk or yoga. This would encourage users to increase their activity levels and lead healthier lifestyles.
 * I would also recommend for the marketing team to gather more data on their Bellbeat product for stress as stress may have correlations to sleep, weight, and a women's menustral cycle. If data suggests there is we can market this feature more prominently seeing as Fitbit does not have this feature.
