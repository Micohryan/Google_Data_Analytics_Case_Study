## Recommendations

 * Based on the trends found Bellbeat should focus marketing the activity features on their Watch product. Based on the Fitbit Data most users tracked their Activity Levels, Calories, and their steps so the same could be true for their Watch Product.
 * More research should be made on why users are not using the weight tracking and sleep features. Are there areas of improvement that people would like to see in the Fitbit that we could add to our products or are people not aware of the feature and or the health benefits of tracking those statistics.
