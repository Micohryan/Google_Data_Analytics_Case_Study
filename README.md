# Google_Data_Analytics_Case_Study

## Intro
Capstone Project for Google Analytics Case Study

## Business Problem
You have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights you discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company. You will present your analysis to the Bellabeat executive team along with your high-level recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.

## Data Source
The data source, "Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data" was found on Kaggle. The datasets were sourced from a survey performed on Amazon Mechanical Turk workers for a study which collected Fitbit tracking data. The original study states 30 participants were surveyed, however 33 can be found in the data. No demographic information such as age, height, or sex was provided. The exact Fitbit models are not specified, but it is noted that variation across the datasets is potentially due to varying device models and user tracking preferences. The data in my analysis is focused during 4-12-2016 to 5-12-2016. The data includes a total of 33 users over 3 datasets tracking data including: physical activity sleep time, and weight information.

## Data Cleaning
I used Google Sheets for data cleaning. Overall the dataset was already pretty clean.

## Data Analysis
Here I downloaded all three of the tables into CSV files. From there I uploaded all the files to my local PostgreSQL database.


1. SQL_Queries for all queries used. 
2. Data Table files resulting from queries
3. Analysis Findings about the data and Visualizations
4. Recommendations Suggested marketing strategy.
