Here in this table we can see that although in the beginning all users were tracking activity in the beginning there seems to be a downward trend of users tracking near the beginning of May. When finally only 21 users were still logging their activity at the end of the month.

 ## 2. Steps

Here we see that the average steps was around 7,000 steps until the very end of the survey period. From the previous table of data logs we can see that users logs were declining around May 1st but total steps were still averaging 7,000 steps. This is due to the people that stopped logging had a low amount of steps. 
 ## 3. Sleep
